Many cities struggle with **uneven water supply**, leaks, excess pumping, and lack of real-time visibility.  
This system provides a **smart monitoring and management platform** that helps municipal authorities:

- Track pump status, flow, and pressure in real time  
- Detect leaks and anomalies early  
- Optimize pumping schedules using data  
- Allow citizens to report shortages or leaks instantly  
- Improve fairness between all supply zones
